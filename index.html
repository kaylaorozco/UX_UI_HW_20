                        1. Running a small-business is very time consuming so SBOs need simpler ways to communicate with customers<br>
                        2. There was a common theme of confusion amongst their customers<br>

                        4. This new information SBOs had to communicate was creating pressure</p>

Combining the two types of posts/notifications saves time for the busy small-business owners.

They were very happy that there was an application that was dedicated to helping SBOs, especially in such a difficult time as a pandemic. One of the problems that arose was the familiarity with geofencing, but once it was understood they thought it was a great idea. With this problem being stated, one way we could solve it would be to put a clearer explanation of it in our Onboarding process.
